    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Nowadays, the field of education is changing and at the same time growing worldwide.

      In many countries, the system is having more relevance because of the quality and the demand as well as the innovative systems. One of the best examples, that we are going to talk about, is the example of online learning in India.
      The new educational trends are being reflected in several studies about distance education.
      The change of education, based on resistance, causes effective learning following systemic evolution, which drives teaching methodologies with the application of technology disrupting with challenges in the educational world, progressing in the penetration of university as well as corporative education.
      The benefits of online education are much higher than negative consequences, nevertheless, legal effects and cautions always have to be take in attention.</p>

    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Educational reforms are the need of the hour…..
      The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development.Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
      We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…</p>

    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small space">Practical oriented curriculum for all subjects could also be considered.
      Also, in the +2 scheme students should be very well allowed to study different subjects from any stream because in the 21st century no subject will survive in isolation, it is very much integrated hence no boundaries of ‘Stream’ should prevail…
      For example, financial technologies or biotechnology or behavioural economics, all are major upcoming fields from different subject specializations.
      A shift from the theoretical framework to a practical framework will certainly help the cause.
      Small steps can be taken if the whole “revolution” seems unfeasible. Sports and Yoga too are great ideas that very well should be incorporated in the school curriculum and the govt is doing good on this…</p>
